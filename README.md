# Semi-Supervised GAN Project

This project demonstrates the use of Semi-Supervised GANs for semi-supervised learning. The script trains a GAN on the MNIST dataset and prints the training loss.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semi_supervised_gan_project.git
    cd semi_supervised_gan_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to train the Semi-Supervised GAN:
```sh
python semi_supervised_gan.py
